Hangman Project

A project for the game Hangman. Rules can be found on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)
The dictionary I used for the game can be found here: https://www.scrapmaker.com/view/twelve-dicts/5desk.txt

While making this game I learned about serialization, JSON and YAML, and how to read/write to and from files with Ruby.

Update:

Rewrote Hangman as a simple web-app and deployed on Heroku.
